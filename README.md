## Background

Big Contest is the biggest data analytics competition with real-world problems in South Korea that is held annually.

Our team, data atelier, took the pledge to participate in the champion league track. There, we solved a sales forecasting task for a home shopping company in the country. 

We, unfortunately, didn't get to win the medals, however, we did make it to the finalist, ranking in top 16 out of 500+ participants.
