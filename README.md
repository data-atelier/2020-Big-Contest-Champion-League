# 2020-Big-Contest-Champion-League

## Background

Big Contest is the biggest data analytics competition in South Korea that is held annually.

Our team, data atelier, took the pledge to participate in the champion league track. There, we solved a sales forecasting task for a home shopping company in the country. 

We, unfortunately, didn't get to win the medals, however, we did make it to the finalist, ranking in top 16 out of 500+ participants.

After the competition, our team decided to share our approach & scripts here in the hope that we could be of any help for all the data science enthusiasts out there. 😉
